# MacGregor-insight-model

This is an R implementation of the problem-solving model which was presented in: 

MacGregor, J. N., Ormerod, T. C., & Chronicle, E. P. (2001). Information processing and insight: a process model of performance on the nine-dot and related problems. Journal of Experimental Psychology. Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 27(1), 176â€“201. Retrieved from http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11204097.

Model produces solution attempts to 9- and 11-dot problems. 
To run the model you need to download 'files' folder and 'sim.R' script. You also need to download or create 'sim_plots' folder in your working directory. Next steps are described in the 'sim.R' script.
